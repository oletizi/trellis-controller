## Project Goal
Enable the step sequencer to run on the physical NeoTrellis M4 device, completing the hardware abstraction with functional I2C communication and real-time operation.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Platform Architecture**: Complete abstraction with interfaces
- ✅ **Simulation Environment**: Fully functional curses-based testing
- ✅ **Core Logic**: StepSequencer with 81%+ test coverage
- ✅ **Embedded Build**: Successfully produces flashable firmware (3.9KB/496KB flash)
- ✅ **Hardware Integration**: I2C/Seesaw protocol implementation complete
- ✅ **System Timer**: SAMD51 SysTick implementation with microsecond precision
- 🔄 **I2C Hardware Driver**: Ready for SAMD51 SERCOM implementation
- ⏳ **Device Testing**: Ready to flash and test on hardware

## Phase 1: Build System Fixes ✅

### Issue Analysis
Current embedded build fails at link time with:
```
undefined reference to `operator delete(void*, unsigned int)`
undefined reference to `atexit`
```

**Root Cause**: C++ features requiring runtime support not available in bare metal environment.

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze linking errors and identify problematic C++ features
- [x] **Implement minimal C++ runtime stubs**
  - Added `operator new/delete` stubs that halt on usage (embedded should use static allocation)
  - Added `atexit` stub that does nothing
  - Added exception handling stubs (`__cxa_pure_virtual`, etc.)
  - Added global constructor support (`__libc_init_array`)
- [x] **Optimize build flags for embedded**
  - Added `-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`
  - Added `-fno-threadsafe-statics -fno-stack-protector`
  - Added linker garbage collection `--gc-sections`
- [x] **Validate embedded build produces flashable firmware**
  - Verified `.elf`, `.hex`, `.bin` file generation
  - Memory usage: **0.69% flash (3.4KB/496KB), 4.54% RAM (8.9KB/192KB)** - excellent!
  - Added linker memory usage reporting

**Success Criteria**: ✅ `make build` produces flashable firmware without link errors.

### Results
- **Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Clean compilation and linking
- **Memory Efficiency**: Extremely efficient usage leaves plenty of room for features
- **File Outputs**: All required formats generated (ELF/HEX/BIN)
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Hardware abstraction layer implementation
