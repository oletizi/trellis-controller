# NeoTrellis M4 Step Sequencer - Development Journey

## Summary
This document chronicles the complete development journey from bare-metal embedded firmware to a working Arduino CLI solution for the NeoTrellis M4 step sequencer project.

## Original Project Goal  
Enable the step sequencer to run on the physical NeoTrellis M4 device, completing the hardware abstraction with functional I2C communication and real-time operation.

## Initial Approach: Bare-Metal Embedded Development

### What We Built
- **Complete platform abstraction architecture** with clean interfaces (`IClock`, `IDisplay`, `IInput`)
- **Fully functional step sequencer core logic** (4 tracks, 8 steps, 120 BPM)
- **SAMD51 hardware drivers** including:
  - Complete I2C master implementation (`SAMD51_I2C.cpp`)
  - Seesaw protocol layer (`SeesawI2C.cpp`) 
  - NeoTrellis display and input drivers
  - Debug serial infrastructure
  - Custom startup code and linker scripts

### Build System Success
- **CMake cross-compilation setup** for ARM Cortex-M4F
- **10KB firmware builds** (1.97% flash usage)
- **Unit tests with 81%+ coverage**
- **Host simulation environment** for development without hardware

### The Firmware Deployment Challenge

#### Problem: UF2 Bootloader Incompatibility
The NeoTrellis M4 uses a **UF2 bootloader**, not the BOSSA bootloader we initially targeted. This led to several critical issues:

1. **Wrong memory layout**: We configured for 0x4000 offset, but UF2 bootloader expects 0x0
2. **Wrong flashing method**: Used `bossac` instead of UF2 file copy
3. **Missing family ID**: UF2 requires specific SAMD51 family ID (`0x55114460`)
4. **Bootloader expectations**: UF2 bootloader may expect specific initialization sequences

#### Debugging Journey
Multiple systematic attempts to resolve the firmware issues:

**Attempt 1**: Register-level hardware debugging
- Created comprehensive I2C hardware driver
- Added extensive debug logging infrastructure
- Result: Firmware built but device showed solid red LED (not running)

**Attempt 2**: Memory layout corrections
- Discovered UF2 vs BOSSA memory layout differences
- Changed linker script from 0x4000 to 0x0 origin
- Added proper UF2 family ID
- Result: Still solid red LED

**Attempt 3**: Startup code analysis
- Analyzed working firmware from bootloader
- Found different vector table format and stack layout
- Added system initialization code
- Created custom reset handlers with diagnostics
- Result: Still solid red LED

**Attempt 4**: Minimal firmware testing
- Created absolute minimal infinite loop firmware
- Added GPIO diagnostic patterns
- Attempted to turn off red LED entirely
- Result: Still solid red LED instantly on startup

**Root Cause**: The UF2 bootloader on NeoTrellis M4 has complex requirements that are not easily met with custom bare-metal firmware. The bootloader likely expects specific Arduino framework initialization or has undocumented dependencies.

## Solution: Arduino CLI Approach

### Why Arduino CLI
- **Proven compatibility** with NeoTrellis M4's UF2 bootloader
- **Professional workflow** compared to Arduino IDE
- **Command-line automation** for builds and uploads
- **Library ecosystem** with official Adafruit support
- **No Python required** (avoiding CircuitPython)

### Setup Process
1. **Install Arduino CLI**: `brew install arduino-cli`
2. **Configure board manager**: Add Adafruit board index URL
3. **Install SAMD core**: `arduino-cli core install adafruit:samd`
4. **Install libraries**: Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Library and dependencies
5. **Create project structure**: Proper Arduino sketch directory layout

### First Success
- **Simple LED test**: 8 red LEDs blinking every second
- **21KB compiled size**: Efficient Arduino framework usage
- **Successful upload**: Using built-in `bossac` integration
- **Hardware verification**: LEDs working as expected

## Architecture Preservation

### Core Logic Reuse
The platform abstraction approach paid off - our core step sequencer logic remains valuable:

```cpp
class SimpleStepSequencer {
    bool pattern[4][8];     // 4 tracks, 8 steps  
    int currentStep;
    bool isPlaying;
    int bpm;
    // ... existing timing and pattern logic
};
```

### Design Patterns Maintained
- **Dependency injection**: Easy to port to Arduino framework
- **Hardware abstraction**: Interfaces still valuable for testing
- **Modular design**: Core logic separated from platform specifics

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Arduino CLI development environment setup
- Adafruit SAMD51 toolchain installation  
- Basic LED control verified on hardware
- Upload process automated and working

### üîÑ Next Steps  
- Port full step sequencer logic to Arduino
- Implement button input handling using NeoTrellis M4 library
- Add 4-track LED patterns with proper colors
- Test complete step sequencer functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **UF2 bootloaders are complex** - Not suitable for quick custom firmware
2. **Arduino ecosystem is mature** - Extensive hardware compatibility  
3. **Platform abstraction works** - Core logic easily portable
4. **Arduino CLI is excellent** - Professional alternative to IDE
5. **Hardware verification first** - Simple tests before complex features

## Development Time Investment
- **Bare-metal approach**: ~4 hours of debugging firmware deployment
- **Arduino CLI setup**: ~30 minutes  
- **First working result**: Immediate success

The Arduino CLI approach was significantly more efficient for getting working firmware on the NeoTrellis M4 hardware.

## Technical Achievements Preserved

### Hardware Abstraction Success
The platform abstraction approach has proven effective:

```cpp
// Core interfaces (platform-agnostic)
class IClock;    // Timing abstraction
class IDisplay;  // LED/display abstraction  
class IInput;    // Button/input abstraction

// Platform implementations
NeoTrellisDisplay    // RGB LED matrix (32 pixels)
NeoTrellisInput     // 4x8 capacitive touch grid
EmbeddedClock       // SAMD51 SysTick timer
```

### Memory Footprint (Bare-Metal)
Optimized for embedded constraints:
- **Flash Usage**: 10KB (1.97% of 512KB)
- **RAM Usage**: 8.8KB (4.52% of 192KB)  
- **Static allocation**: No dynamic memory
- **Zero-copy operations**: Efficient LED updates

### Codebase Quality
- **81%+ test coverage** with comprehensive unit tests
- **Platform-independent core** with dependency injection
- **Clean abstractions** enabling easy testing and portability
- **Self-documenting code** with clear interfaces

## Development Commands

### Arduino CLI Workflow
```bash
# Setup (one time)
arduino-cli core install adafruit:samd
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Library"

# Development cycle
arduino-cli compile --fqbn adafruit:samd:adafruit_trellis_m4 arduino_trellis
arduino-cli upload --fqbn adafruit:samd:adafruit_trellis_m4 -p /dev/cu.usbmodem31101 arduino_trellis
```

### Bare-Metal Workflow (for reference)
```bash
# Build cross-compiled firmware
make build

# Manual UF2 upload (if needed)
python3 /tmp/uf2conv.py -f 0x55114460 -b 0x0 -c -o firmware.uf2 firmware.bin
cp firmware.uf2 /Volumes/TRELM4BOOT/
```

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
1. **Complete Arduino step sequencer** - Port all core logic
2. **Button input integration** - Real-time pattern editing
3. **Performance optimization** - Ensure stable timing

### Long-term  
1. **Pattern persistence** - Save to flash memory
2. **MIDI integration** - External sync and control
3. **Advanced features** - Swing timing, pattern chaining
4. **Bare-metal revisit** - Once Arduino version is stable, potentially return to custom firmware for maximum performance

The foundation is solid - the clean architecture enables rapid iteration in the Arduino environment while preserving the option to return to bare-metal development in the future.
