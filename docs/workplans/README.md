# Workplan Archive Organization

This directory contains all workplans for the NeoTrellis M4 step sequencer project, organized by implementation status.

## Directory Structure

### `implemented/`
Contains workplans that have been successfully implemented and are part of the current system:

- **`2025-09-02-WORKPLAN.md`** - Initial step sequencer implementation
  - Basic 4-track, 8-step sequencer functionality
  - Button matrix scanning and LED control
  - MIDI output capabilities
  - Platform abstraction architecture foundation

- **`2025-09-03-WORKPLAN.md`** - Pattern management system
  - Multi-pattern storage and switching
  - Pattern chaining capabilities
  - Enhanced user interface controls

- **`2025-09-05-WORKPLAN-SHIFT-KEYS.md`** - Shift key functionality
  - Secondary control layer accessed via shift button
  - Extended sequencer controls and navigation
  - Pattern management shortcuts

### `backlog/`
Contains workplans that are planned but not yet started:

- **`WORKPLAN-SAMPLER.md`** - Audio sampler implementation
  - Professional audio sampler with SFZ/DecentSampler support
  - Stereo DAC output and USB file transfer
  - Dual-mode operation (sequencer/sampler)
  - **Status**: Awaiting Teensy integration decision or M4-native audio implementation

### `rejected/`
Contains workplans that were evaluated but rejected due to architectural or technical concerns:

- **`2025-09-06-WORKPLAN-PARAMETER-LOCKS.md`** - Original parameter locks design
  - **Rejection Reason**: Architect review identified critical architectural issues
  - **Issues**: Raw pointer usage, dynamic allocation, incomplete performance analysis
  - **Resolution**: Revised as WORKPLAN-PARAMETER-LOCKS-v2.md with memory pool architecture

## Naming Convention

Workplans follow the naming pattern:
- **Date-prefixed**: `YYYY-MM-DD-WORKPLAN-FEATURE.md` for time-sensitive or version-specific plans
- **Feature-named**: `WORKPLAN-FEATURE.md` for general feature implementations
- **Versioned**: `WORKPLAN-FEATURE-v2.md` for revised plans after architectural review

## Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Implemented**: Feature is complete and integrated into the main codebase
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Currently being developed
- üìã **Backlog**: Planned for future implementation
- ‚ùå **Rejected**: Determined to be architecturally unsound or technically infeasible
- üîÑ **Revised**: Original plan rejected, new version created addressing concerns

## Process Flow

1. **New workplans** are created in the project root
2. **Active development** workplans remain in root during implementation
3. **Completed workplans** move to `implemented/` with date prefix
4. **Future plans** move to `backlog/`
5. **Rejected plans** move to `rejected/` with documentation of rejection reasons
6. **Revised plans** replace rejected ones, with original preserved for reference

## Architectural Review Process

All major workplans undergo architectural review before implementation:
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Platform abstraction compliance verification
- Performance impact analysis
- Memory usage validation
- Integration complexity evaluation

Reviews are documented within the workplan files and guide the implementation process.

## Current Active Workplan

**`WORKPLAN-PARAMETER-LOCKS-v2.md`** - Parameter locks implementation (revised)
- Memory pool architecture addressing embedded constraints
- Pre-calculation engine for real-time performance
- Adaptive user interface with ergonomic validation
- Comprehensive monitoring and testing framework
